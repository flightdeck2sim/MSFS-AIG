# Alpaca Airways (VCP) Model Matching for MSFS
<b>VATSIM / IVAO model matching solution using the AIG AI Manager OCI for MSFS (and P3D)</b><br>
<br>
In order to make the Alpha India Group's AI Manager (AIGAIM) integration of
our repaints work for model matching purposes, we have put up a flightplan that
uses two larger Central African airports (FZAA and HRYR), creating one return
flight (= 2 legs) for each aircraft once a week - starting on Monday 00z00. If you
are regular user of AIG's TrafficController, please understand that you will encounter
Alpaca Airways planes at these airports at the set times.<br>
<br>
While AIG's focus is to populate Microsoft Flight Simulator with real world traffic
throughout the world, this flightplan does not reflect real world operations. We are
in no way affiliated with AIG.<br>
<br>
The first release already contains over 50 repaints for over 20 different aircraft models and their variants. Flightplan and repaint repository will be updated regularly, so make sure to check back in from time to time.<br>
